- Pre-emptively Answered Questions:

- How do I use manual turrets?


Stand on the same tile that the turret is on, have your hands free, and "f"ire it.



- How do I make automated turrets?


Craft a turret chassis (Electronics, Mechanics, and Fabrication must be at 5 to see the recipe) and install it. 
You can then install most non-pistol weapons as an automated turret.



- My automated turrets won't fire!


Make sure turrets are enabled by using your vehicle controls.

Make sure turrets have access to appropriate ammo. 
Turrets that use gas or battery power need appropriate containers.

Make sure to check "Configure Individual Turrets" in the vehicle control menu.
 
Turrets all have different ranges at which they'll shoot, the enemy might still be out of range.

Explosive turrets won't fire if the target is too close to the vehicle.



- I don't understand the individual turret options.


The squares next to the turret's name show its setting.

Blank means it will not fire. 

"1" means it will only fire a single shot (If it has a burst option). 

"B" means it will fire full bursts.

"m" means it will only fire if you control it by using "f"ire while having free hands while being on the same tile as the vehicle's controls.


If you're using a turret that doesn't have burst fire, it will be blank or "x" for off/on.

Turrets that can only be manually fired won't appear on the configuration menu.



- Blob parts? Vortex parts? Diamond parts?


For blob parts you need cooking at level 6 to see the first recipe, 7 to see them all. 
You also need fabrication at 5.


For vortex parts, you need to "r"ead a vortex stone to see the recipes.


For diamond parts you need to "r"ead spiral stones. Diamond parts require a certain rock in order to make the general frame, but other parts have their replacements.


Everything else is up for you to find.



- I have a question that this doesn't answer./I found a bug./I have a suggestion.
